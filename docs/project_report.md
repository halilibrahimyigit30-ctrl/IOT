## Introduction
  Coastal fisheries play an important role in food supply and local economies. One of the main challenges in small-scale coastal fishing is predicting when fish schools will approach a specific area. Fishermen often rely on experience and manual observation, which can be inefficient and unreliable.

  With the advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, hydroacoustic (sonar) sensors and environmental monitoring systems enable continuous and automated data collection in marine environments. These sensors provide valuable information about underwater activity, water conditions, and environmental factors that influence fish behavior.

  In this project, we develop a data-driven approach to predict the short-term approach probability of coastal fish schools using IoT-based sonar data combined with environmental variables such as water temperature, tide level, and wind conditions. The proposed system aims to provide early warnings that support efficient fishing operations, reduce fuel and time costs, and contribute to sustainable fisheries management.
